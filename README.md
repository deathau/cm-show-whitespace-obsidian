### Compatibility

Custom plugins are only available for Obsidian v0.9.7+.

The current API of this repo targets Obsidian **v0.10.0**. 

### Notes
This is all very expermental at the moment, so parts might not work, etc.  
There are certain css classes, etc that can interfere with it and make the whitespace characters stand out more.  
Check out the styles.css in the release to see what styles are added to be customized.

You can override the following CSS variables in your custom CSS to use different characters if you wish.
  - `--spaceChar`
  - `--trailingSpaceChar`
  - `--singleSpaceChar`
  - `--tabChar`
  - `--newlineChar`
  - `--strictLineBreakChar`

Example:

```css
body.plugin-cm-show-whitespace {
  --strictLineBreakChar: "â†²" !important;
}
```

## Installation

### From within Obsidian
From Obsidian v0.9.8, you can activate this plugin within Obsidian by doing the following:
- Open Settings > Third-party plugin
- Make sure Safe mode is **off**
- Click Browse community plugins
- Search for "Show Whitespace"
- Click Install
- Once installed, close the community plugins window and activate the newly installed plugin
#### Updates
You can follow the same procedure to update the plugin

### From GitHub
- Download the [Latest release](https://github.com/deathau/cm-show-whitespace-obsidian/releases/latest)
- Extract the `cm-show-whitespace-obsidian` folder from the zip to your vault's plugins folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`  
Note: On some machines the `.obsidian` folder may be hidden. On MacOS you should be able to press `Command+Shift+Dot` to show the folder in Finder.
- Reload Obsidian
- If prompted about Safe Mode, you can disable safe mode and enable the plugin.
Otherwise head to Settings, third-party plugins, make sure safe mode is off and
enable the plugin from there.

## Development

This project uses Typescript to provide type checking and documentation.  
The repo depends on the latest [plugin API](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api) in Typescript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

**Note:** The Obsidian API is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!

If you want to contribute to development and/or just customize it with your own
tweaks, you can do the following:
- Clone this repo.
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies
- `npm run build` to compile.
- Copy `manifest.json`, `main.js` and `styles.css` to a subfolder of your plugins
folder (e.g, `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/cm-show-whitespace-obsidian/`)
- Reload obsidian to see changes

Alternately, you can clone the repo directly into your plugins folder and once
dependencies are installed use `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.  
You may have to reload obsidian (`ctrl+R`) to see changes.
